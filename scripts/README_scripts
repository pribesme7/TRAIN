In this folder several python scripts can be found. The codes are not documented and were developed for self-usage.
The files that contain "analyze" are scripts that do scans in roll angle, transverse separation and parallel crossing angle using TRAIN.
The files that contain "plot" were developed as fast scripts for plotting the outputs obtained from TRAIN.
The files containing "ext" were use for analysis with extra elements introduced with the option on_ext, mainly of the crab cavities and the triplets.
